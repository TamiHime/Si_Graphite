# Si_Graphite

A recent presentation by Coreshell at the Volta Foundation highlighted ongoing efforts to eliminate graphite from lithium-ion battery anodes by adopting metallurgical-grade silicon as a complete replacement. 

Motivated by this development, I used PyBaMM to investigate the impact of increasing silicon content in the negative electrode on the electrochemical performance of a full cell. The model begins with a positive electrode composed of NMC, based on the Chen et al. (2020) parameter set, and systematically varies the silicon-to-graphite ratio to examine resulting changes in voltage profiles and cell capacity.
